## This is my report!

I like writing **reports**



```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library("knitr")
source("exercise.R")
```


```{r example, echo = FALSE}
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers)
```

The mean of the numbers happens to be **`r numbers_mean`**.

```{r other_chunk}
print(numbers)
```
